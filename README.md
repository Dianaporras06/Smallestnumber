This Java program is designed to read a series of integers from the user and find the smallest value among them. The approach is modular, with separate methods for key tasks.
It starts by reading the number of inputs, then iterates through the given values, continuously comparing each one to the current minimum. The program makes use of 
clear variable names like totalNumeros (total numbers) and numeroMinimo (minimum number) to enhance readability. Additionally, the logic for determining the smallest 
number is encapsulated in a helper method, obtenerMenor, which uses the ternary operator for conciseness. The program is user-friendly, with informative prompts guiding the 
input process. It also employs good practices like closing the scanner after use to free up resources.
